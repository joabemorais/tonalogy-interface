# Tonalogy Interface

Web-based Client for Harmonic Progression Analysis

## Project Context

This repository contains the official web frontend for the Tonalogy project. Its purpose is to provide a user-friendly graphical interface for interacting with the Tonalogy API. For a complete conceptual overview of the Tonalogy system, its theoretical foundations, and its academic goals, please refer to [the main project documentation](https://github.com/joabemorais/tonalogy).

## Core Functionality

This web application allows users to:

- Submit harmonic progressions for formal analysis.
- Receive and visualize the diagrams generated by the backend, representing tonal paths and modulations.
- View detailed explanations and semantic justifications for the tonal analysis provided by the API.

## Technology Stack
