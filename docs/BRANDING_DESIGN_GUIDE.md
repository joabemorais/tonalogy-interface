## 3. Icon Design Concepts

### Concept A: Musical Logic Symbol
**Visual Elements:**
- **Base**: Circular or rounded square foundation
- **Primary Symbol**: Stylized treble clef merged with logic symbol (∃ or →)
- **Secondary Elements**: Subtle geometric patterns suggesting harmonic progressions
- **Color**: Primary blue (#5b9df9) on dark/light backgrounds

**Conceptual Rationale:**
- Treble clef immediately identifies musical context
- Logic symbol represents the analytical/computational aspect
- Geometric patterns suggest the structured nature of harmonic analysis

### Concept B: Harmonic Wave Structure
**Visual Elements:**
- **Base**: Square or circular container
- **Primary Symbol**: Abstract sine wave pattern transforming into geometric steps
- **Pattern**: Wave progression showing tonal movement
- **Color**: Gradient from primary blue to lighter tint

**Conceptual Rationale:**
- Wave pattern represents harmonic content
- Geometric transformation shows analytical process
- Progressive pattern suggests the concept of progression analysis

### Concept C: Kripke Structure Visualization
**Visual Elements:**
- **Base**: Minimal geometric frame
- **Primary Symbol**: Connected nodes representing possible worlds
- **Connections**: Flowing lines between nodes
- **Hierarchy**: Central node (tonic) with satellite connections

**Conceptual Rationale:**
- Directly represents the Kripke semantics foundation
- Node network suggests computational analysis
- Central/satellite structure reflects tonal hierarchy

### Concept D: Musical Progression Path
**Visual Elements:**
- **Base**: Modern geometric container
- **Primary Symbol**: Stylized chord progression bars with ascending/flowing motion
- **Movement**: Left-to-right progression with subtle animation potential
- **Integration**: Musical and analytical elements unified

**Conceptual Rationale:**
- Immediately conveys progression analysis
- Geometric bars suggest both musical bars and data visualization
- Motion implies the analytical process

### Recommended Concept: Hybrid Approach
**Combining elements from Concepts A and D:**
- **Primary Symbol**: Minimalist treble clef integrated with geometric progression bars
- **Base**: Rounded square with subtle corner radius (8px at standard sizes)
- **Color Treatment**: Primary blue with subtle depth/gradient
- **Scalability**: Vector-based design that works from 16px to 512px+
